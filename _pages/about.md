I'm a first year PhD student from [Sonny Astani Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering](https://cee.usc.edu/), University of Southern California. My research interest includes reinforcement learning, game theory in intelligent transportation systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ruolin Li](https://ruolinli.me/).

You can find my CV here: [Kexin Wang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
